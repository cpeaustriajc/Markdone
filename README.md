# [Markdone][markdone] - Get more things done with Markdone

An open source markdown editor built with the latest open source technologies in
Next.js and React

This used to be my own personal markdown editor for editing directly in my
github repository that was used for my personal portfolio.

In the early versions of this app, this was based on the tutorial of [devaslife]
and the blog post by [0xsuk]. These two content produced by magnificent
engineers bootstrapped this project.

> **Warning** Markdone is still in it's early version, the features that are
> required for it to be a full pledged markdown editor is not implemented yet.
> Use with caution!
