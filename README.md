# Markdone - Get more things done with Markdone!

This used to be my own personal markdown editor for editing directly in my
github repository in my personal portfolio. If you manage to discover this
repository, this means that you are part of the growing team of the
creators of the markdone app.

In the early versions of this app, this was based on the tutorial of
[devaslife] and the blog post by [0xsuk]. These two content produced
by magnificent engineers bootstrapped this project.

Markdone is still in it's early version. It will become a proprietary app in
the future.
